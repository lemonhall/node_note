I think there are two issues here, and also the input looks truncated or damaged, so results may vary.

1. avconv is buggy (as usual)

It shows the input audio stream having 0 channels which is wrong.

Get a recent build of ffmpeg. I don't know what Ubuntu version you're using, so the easiest method is to use a recent static build. Just download, extract, and run. Also, you tagged your question with ffmpeg, so I assume you would be willing to use it instead (avconv != ffmpeg). It should show the proper number of audio channels.

2. Use a compatible output container format

Matroska

This will stream copy (re-mux) the video and re-encode the audio:

ffmpeg -i input -c:v copy -c:a aac output.mkv

Re-encoding the audio is probably required in this case because the Matroska muxer will refuse to mux an audio stream with invalid extradata.
Older ffmpeg builds will require -strict experimental for the AAC encoder.
MP4

This will re-encode the video and stream copy the audio:

ffmpeg -i input -c:v libx264 -c:a copy -bsf:a aac_adtstoasc output.mp4

In this case the aac_adtstoasc bitstream filter is required. Newer ffmpeg builds may add this automatically.
